				Universally recognised as the greatest tennis player in the world (perhaps even the universe) its arguable that Roger Federer might indeed be the greatest living athlete of all time. You may disagree but it is nonetheless worth arguing.
				 By sheer nonchalance and seeming lack of exertion in the game, Federer is quite literally leaps and bounds ahead of his (increasingly younger) competitors. 
				 Whilst other athletes at the top of their game put in the mammoth hours in training, with blood, sweat and tears, Federer has an uncanny ability to effortlessly glide across centre court with the kind of grace that seems almost super human. 
				 Even in Rafa Nadal’s autobiography he said of his long time competitior, ‘I’ve had to push and mould my body to adapt it to cope with the repetitive muscle stress that tennis forces on you, but he (Federer) just seems to have been born to play the game. 
				 His physique – his DNA – seems perfectly adapted to tennis.’ Recall, if you can, the epic 2008 final between Nadal and Federer, where he saved a match point in a beautiful and seemingly effortless single handed back hand. 
				 Federer’s game is the nearest thing to perfection in tennis, blurring the lines between sport and art. 
				 Novelist David Foster Wallace famously described Federer as ‘a creature whose body is both flesh, and somehow, light.’
				 And with the passing of Wimbledon this year, Federer’s record breaking achievements did not stop, winning his eighth title against Marin Cilic, without dropping a single set during the whole tournament, shedding tears of joy at the final. 
				 And on how deliciously gr(eight) it was, after many years of being put aside as a late great. Federer said upon winning, ‘It’s disbelief I can achieve such great heights. But I always believed. I kept on believing and dreaming I could get back.’ There was not a dry eye in the house.
				 So, what is it about Federer that inspires such adulation and admiration, both on and off the court? Luxury brands are literally queuing up to Roger’s golden touch. 
				 His endorsement portfolio is quite possibly the ibest amongst celebrities across sports, film and music domains. With global brands such as Nike, Mercedes, Rolex and Wilson under his belt, it really does seem that the boy wonder can do no wrong. 
				 Of course, this cannot be on sheer talent on court, even for someone who is up there with a god-like ability for the game.

				<article>      <p><span class="years">[2014-2017]</span><p>Roger Federer (German pronunciation: [ˈrɔdʒər ˈfeːdərər]; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player who is ranked world No. 3 in men's singles tennis by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).[3] He has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles—the most in history by a male player—and has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for a record total of 310 weeks (including a record 237 consecutive weeks) and was the year-end No. 1 five times, including four consecutive. Federer, who turned professional in 1998, was continuously ranked in the top ten from October 2002 to November 2016.

Federer has won a record eight Wimbledon men's singles titles, six Australian Open titles, five US Open titles (all consecutive, a record), and one French Open title. He is one of eight men to have achieved a Career Grand Slam. Federer has reached a record 31 men's singles Grand Slam finals, including 10 consecutively from the 2005 Wimbledon Championships to the 2007 US Open. Federer has also won a record six ATP Finals titles, 28 ATP Tour Masters 1000 titles, and a record 24 ATP Tour 500 titles. Federer was a member of Switzerland's winning Davis Cup team in 2014. He is also the only player after Jimmy Connors to have won 100 or more career singles titles, as well as to amass 1,200 wins in the Open Era.

Federer's all-court game and versatile style of play involve exceptional footwork and shot-making.[4] Effective both as a baseliner and a volleyer, his apparent effortlessness and efficient movement on the court have made Federer highly popular among tennis fans. He has received the tour Sportsmanship Award 13 times and been named the ATP Player of the Year and ITF World Champion five times. He has won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award a record five times, including four consecutive awards from 2005 to 2008. He is also the only person to have won the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year award four times.

				<article>       <p><span class="years">[2011-2013]</span><p>Federer was born in Basel, Switzerland.[5] His father, Robert Federer, is a Swiss-German from Berneck in the Canton of St. Gallen, and his mother, Lynette Federer (née Durand), is an Afrikaner from Kempton Park, Gauteng, in South Africa. Federer has one sibling, his older sister, Diana,[6] who is the mother of a set of twins.[7] Since his mother is South African, he holds both Swiss and South African citizenship.[8] He grew up in nearby Birsfelden, Riehen, and then Münchenstein, close to the French and German borders, and he speaks Swiss German, Standard German, English, and French fluently, as well as functional Italian and Swedish; Swiss German is his native language.[5][9][10][11] Federer served as a ball boy at his hometown Basel tournament, the Swiss Indoors, in 1992 and 1993.[9][12]


Federer's signature
Like all male Swiss citizens, Federer was subject to compulsory military service in the Swiss Armed Forces. However, in 2003 he was ruled "unsuitable" and was subsequently not required to fulfill his military obligation.[13] Instead, he served in the civil protection force and was required to pay 3% of his taxable income as an alternative.[14] He grew up supporting FC Basel and the Swiss national football team.[15] Federer also credits his hand-eye coordination to the wide range of sports he played as a child, including badminton and basketball.[16]

				<article>       <p><span class="years">[2009-2010]</span><p>Federer entered the top 100 ranking for the first time on 20 September 1999 and started at the 1999 Marseille Open defeating the reigning champion of the 1998 French Open, Spaniard Carlos Moyá. His first final came at the Marseille Open in 2000, where he lost to fellow Swiss Marc Rosset.[25] Federer won the 2001 Hopman Cup representing Switzerland, along with world No. 1 Martina Hingis.[26][27][28] The duo defeated the American pair of Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill in the finals. Federer later said that his experience with Hingis "definitely helped me to become the player I am today."[29]

Federer's first singles win was at the 2001 Milan Indoor tournament, where he defeated Julien Boutter in the final.[25] Although he won his first title already in 1999 on the Challenger tour, winning the doubles event in Segovia, Spain with Dutchman Sander Groen, the final was played on Federer's 18th birthday. In 2001, Federer made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open, losing to former world No. 2 and eventual finalist Alex Corretja. His run to the French quarterfinals launched him into the top 15 for the first time in his career.[30]

His international breakthrough came at the 2001 Wimbledon Championships, where the 19-year-old Federer faced the four-time defending champion and all-time Grand Slam leader Pete Sampras. Federer beat the No. 1 seed in a five-set match to reach the quarterfinals.[31] In the quarters he faced Englishman Tim Henman, eventually losing in a fourth-set tiebreaker.[citation needed]

The first final he reached at the Masters level came at the 2002 Miami Masters event, where he lost to former and future No. 1 Andre Agassi on hard court.[32] Federer won his first Master Series event at the 2002 Hamburg Masters on clay, over Marat Safin; the victory put him in top 10 for the first time.[32] Federer made 10 singles finals between 1998 and 2002, of which he won four and lost six.[25][32][33][34][30] He also made six finals in doubles. He finished 2001 with an ATP ranking of No. 13, and 2002 was the first year he was ranked within the top 10, finishing at No. 6</p>  </p>    </article>

				<article>       <p><span class="years">[2005-2008]</span><p>In 2007, Federer reached all four Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of them again. He won the Australian Open without dropping a set, beating Fernando González in the final. This made him the first man in the 21st century to accomplish the feat, as Björn Borg at the 1980 French Open was the last to win a Grand Slam tournament without the loss of a set.[42] Federer had entered the year on a huge winning streak and after capturing his fourth Dubai crown Federer's winning streak stood at 41 matches, the longest of his career and only five shy of the record. Federer entered Indian Wells as the three-time defending champion, but his streak ended in controversy. He was defeated by an Argentine, Guillermo Cañas, who had failed a drug test for illegal doping.[43]


Federer was coined "Darth Federer" by fans and commentators at the 2007 US Open
This surprising first-round defeat marked the first time since August 2006 he suffered defeat, a period spanning over seven months.[citation needed]

During the clay season, Federer's victory in the Hamburg Masters final was particularly impressive, as it snapped Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set bagel. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in a repeat of the previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.[44]

At Wimbledon, Federer entered the tournament not only as the four-time defending champion, but also riding a 48-match winning streak on grass. Once again, he defeated Rafael Nadal for a second consecutive year in the final, this time in a thrilling five-set encounter that many analysts hailed as the greatest Wimbledon final since 1980. Victory at Wimbledon equaled him with Björn Borg for the record of five consecutive championships at the All England Club.[citation needed]

Federer reached the final in Montreal before playing a young and relatively unknown Serbian named Novak Djokovic. Djokovic proved his potential by beating the world No. 1 in a final-set tiebreaker upset. Federer rebounded in Cincinnati to capture his fifth title of the year. Federer entered the US Open as the three-time defending champion and faced Djokovic in the final. This time, Federer prevailed in a close straight-set match. Victory in New York moved him ahead of Laver and Borg for third on the all-time list of major championship victories. Throughout the tournament, the American press labelled him Darth Federer for his all-black attire (which included tuxedo-striped shorts) and the tournament played The Imperial March from Star Wars when he was announced onto the court for each of his matches.[45] He closed out the year with victories in Basel and the Year End Championships in Shanghai.[citation needed]

He finished the season as the year-end No. 1 for the fourth year in a row, demonstrating his dominance, and during these four years he won 11 Grand Slam singles titles. After his phenomenal triple Grand Slam season yet again, Federer became the only player in history to win three Majors in a year for three years (2004, 2006, 2007). It was the third consecutive season that Federer held the No. 1 ranking for all 52 weeks of the year.</p> </p>   </article>

				<article>       <p><span class="years">[1998-2004]</span><p>The generic power-baseline game is not boring — certainly not compared with the two-second points of old-time serve-and-volley or the moon-ball tedium of classic baseline attrition. But it is somewhat static and limited; it is not, as pundits have publicly feared for years, the evolutionary endpoint of tennis. The player who’s shown this to be true is Roger Federer. And he’s shown it from within the modern game.

This within is what’s important here; this is what a purely neural account leaves out. And it is why sexy attributions like touch and subtlety must not be misunderstood. With Federer, it’s not either/or. The Swiss has every bit of Lendl and Agassi’s pace on his groundstrokes, and leaves the ground when he swings, and can out-hit even Nadal from the backcourt.(17) What’s strange and wrong about Wimbledon’s sign, really, is its overall dolorous tone. Subtlety, touch, and finesse are not dead in the power-baseline era. For it is, still, in 2006, very much the power-baseline era: Roger Federer is a first-rate, kick-ass power-baseliner. It’s just that that’s not all he is. There’s also his intelligence, his occult anticipation, his court sense, his ability to read and manipulate opponents, to mix spins and speeds, to misdirect and disguise, to use tactical foresight and peripheral vision and kinesthetic range instead of just rote pace — all this has exposed the limits, and possibilities, of men’s tennis as it’s now played.

Which sounds very high-flown and nice, of course, but please understand that with this guy it’s not high-flown or abstract. Or nice. In the same emphatic, empirical, dominating way that Lendl drove home his own lesson, Roger Federer is showing that the speed and strength of today’s pro game are merely its skeleton, not its flesh. He has, figuratively and literally, re-embodied men’s tennis, and for the first time in years the game’s future is unpredictable. You should have seen, on the grounds’ outside courts, the variegated ballet that was this year’s Junior Wimbledon. Drop volleys and mixed spins, off-speed serves, gambits planned three shots ahead — all as well as the standard-issue grunts and booming balls. Whether anything like a nascent Federer was here among these juniors can’t be known, of course. Genius is not replicable. Inspiration, though, is contagious, and multiform — and even just to see, close up, power and aggression made vulnerable to beauty is to feel inspired and (in a fleeting, mortal way) reconciled.</p></p>
